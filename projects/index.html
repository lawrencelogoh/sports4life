				<h2>Past Projects: Empowering Through <br /> Sports and Education</h2>
				<p>
					Over the years, Sports 4 Life Ministries has been dedicated to creating positive change through
					various <br />
					initiatives. Notable among these are our two basketball facilities:</p>
				<p>
					1.<b> The First Basketball Court (WIBLE ARENA):</b> Funded by a generous couple who wish to remain

					anonymous, this court has been a cornerstone for our programs. It has served as a hub for multiple

					camps
					and weekly gatherings for athletes participating in our programs.
				</p>
				<p> 2.<b> The Second Basketball Court (WILSHIRE BAPTIST COURT):</b> Made possible by the Wilshire
					Baptist
					Church in Dallas, TX, this court has extended our reach and impact in the community. It, too, serves
					as
					a meeting point for athletes and participants.
				</p>
				<p>
					These courts represent our commitment to sports, education, and community development. They are

					testaments to the transformative power of partnership and dedication to our mission.
